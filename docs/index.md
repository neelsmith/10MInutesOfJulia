# 10 minutes of Julia

This site hosts Pluto notebooks introducing basic features of the Julia language. You should be able to read through a notebook in 10 minutes or less, and use it as a starting point for experimenting with your own code.

## Who is this site for?

There are *lots* of resources for learning Julia, aimed at many different audiences.  This site assumes no background of any kind other than curiosity. If you've never programmed before, you should be able to work through the notebooks introducing "some Julia fundamentals" in a coupld of hours.  If you spread that time out over a few days with a little additional experimentation of your own, you should feel capable of starting to do some practical things with Julia.  You may subsequently want to work through the second series of 10-minute notebooks, "Building on fundamentals,"  which expand on each other to compare the four surviving versions of Abraham Lincoln's Gettysburg Address.

I especially hope that these notebooks might be useful for students interested in humanities subjects who might not have had a CS course, or might have had a negative experience with formal CS courses, but wonder if they could put together basic scripts to work with digital texts or data.

## Notebooks: some Julia fundamentals

>  **NB**: Each notebook displays a version number using the major/minor/patch scheme of [semantic versioning](https://semver.org).  Versions < 1.0.0 are incomplete work in progress. Changes in **major** number indicate a change incompatible or conflicting with the previous version.  Changes in **minor** number indicate addition of new material compatible with the prior version.  Changes in **patch** numbers indicate correction of errors.

As these eight notebooks introduce you to some fundamentals of the Julia language, you will gradually build up an interactive application for managing a contacts list with names and phone numbers of people and businesses.

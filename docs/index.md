## Notebooks

Each notebook displays a version number using the major/minor/patch scheme of [semantic versioning](https://semver.org).  Versions < 1.0.0 are incomplete work in progress. Changes in *major* number indicate a change incompatible or conflicting with the previous version.  Changes in *minor* number indicate addition of new material compatible with the prior version.  Changes in *patch* numbers indicate correction of errors.
